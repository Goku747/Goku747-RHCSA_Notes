A user who doesn't need to be root or owner of the file or doesn't belong to any group (which have permission access), can have access to files. 
This can be done using Access Control List.
FILES:
to get the acess control list for a file - getfacl filename
to set the acess control list for a file - setfacl -m u:username:rwx filename
-m - modify
setting the access control list modifies the mask value which is the maximum permission to be set for a file. This means even if the file permissions has been changed
for the specific file, the user or group to whom file permissions are set using setfacl would not have the same permissions as set using setfacl command.
To change the permission of mask for a file, 
1. chmod u+rw filename - will also set the same permissions for mask value as well (or)
2. setfacl -m m::rw filename

DIRECTORIES:
To set access control list on directories, two things need to be done.

1. set or modify default values for specific user or group for that directory, in ACL - setfacl -d -m u:username:rwx directoryname
NOTE: For directory always make sure to give execute permissions, since a user can only read or write or create files in a directory, if he has execute permissions.
-d - defaults
when this is set , the file inside directory will be created with default permissions.
But inorder for other users, to create a file, they should first have write permissions on that directory. For this, 
2. set or modify the value again for user or group in ACL - setfacl -m u:username:rw directoryname 

To remove the default permission for a directory - setfacl -k directoryname

Copy Access control list permissions:

getfacl file1 | setfacl --set-file=- file2
- - specifies that the permission values come from standard output.
